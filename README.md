# Power Automate: Send an HTTP Request to Retrieve and Format Emails

This project demonstrates how to use Microsoft Power Automate to retrieve more than 25 emails from an inbox using the "Send an HTTP request" action, filter the data, and convert it into an HTML table.

## How It Works

1. Data Retrieval**: The default "Get emails" action in Power Automate typically retrieves only 25 emails. To retrieve more, use the "Send an HTTP request" action. For example, use the following endpoint to fetch 50 emails:
   ```plaintext
   https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/your_email_adress/mailFolders/Inbox/messages?$top=50&$select=sender,subject,body
   ```

2. Filtering: Use the $select query parameter to filter the data you retrieve. For instance, you can specify only the sender, subject, and body fields.

3. Variable Initialization: Use the "Initialize variable" action to convert the retrieved email data into an array format.

4. Data Looping: Utilize the "Apply to each" action to loop through the email data, processing and formatting it as needed.
  ```plaintext
   body('Send_an_HTTP_request')?['value']
   ```
5. Append to array variable
  ```plaintext
{
  "eMails Subject": @{item()?['subject']}
}
  ``` 
6. HTML Table Creation: Convert the processed email data into an HTML table using the "Create HTML table" action.
